Que2. What is Normalization?

Ans-> Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them, following a set of rules (called normal forms) to ensure that the data is stored efficiently and consistently.
1) First Normal Form (1NF)
2) Second Normal Form (2NF)
3) Third Normal Form (3NF)
4) Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
5) Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
6) Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

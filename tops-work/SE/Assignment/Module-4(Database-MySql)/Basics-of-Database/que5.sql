Que5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

Ans-> Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple locations within a database or a system. This redundancy can lead to several problems, including data inconsistency, inefficient storage, and difficulty in data maintenance. However, in certain cases, some level of data redundancy can be intentional for optimization purposes, such as improving query performance through denormalization.

Que3. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

Ans->

Feature	                    DBMS	                                  RDBMS
Full Form	        Database Management System	        Relational Database Management System
Data Structure:	    Stores data as files, hierarchical, Stores data in tables (relations)
                    network	

Normalization:	    Not typically supported	            Supports normalization (avoids 
                                                        redundancy)

Data Integrity:	    Does not enforce strong 	        Enforces data integrity with primary/
                    data integrity                      foreign keys

Support for SQL:    May not use SQL	                    Uses SQL for database operations

ACID Compliance:    Usually not ACID-compliant	        Fully ACID-compliant

Relationships:	    No relationships between data	    Establishes relationships between 
                                                        tables

Multi-user 	        Typically single-user systems	    Supports multi-user and concurrent 
Support:                                                access.

Data Redundancy:    Higher redundancy	                Lower redundancy due to normalization

Example Systems:    File systems, XML, IMS	            MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

3. What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC ?
-> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned Information Technology infrastructure.

    Phases of SDLC

    1. Planning:
        Objective: Define the scope and purpose of the software project.
        Activities:
        Feasibility study
        Resource allocation
        Risk analysis
        Project scheduling

    2. Requirements Analysis:
        Objective: Gather and analyze business and user requirements.
        Activities:
        Conduct interviews, surveys, and meetings
        Document requirements
        Create requirement specifications

    3. Design:
        Objective: Define the system architecture and design.
        Activities:
        High-level design (HLD): overall system architecture
        Low-level design (LLD): detailed design of modules and components
        Define database schema
        Create user interfaces and design prototypes

    4. Implementation (Coding):
        Objective: Transform the design into executable code.
        Activities:
        Write code according to design specifications
        Follow coding standards and guidelines
        Conduct code reviews and unit testing

    5. Testing:
        Objective: Identify and fix defects in the software.
        Activities:
        Develop test plans and test cases
        Conduct various tests: unit, integration, system, acceptance
        Log defects and track their resolution

    6. Deployment:
        Objective: Release the software to the production environment.
        Activities:
        Prepare deployment documentation
        Install and configure the software
        Perform deployment testing
        Train users and provide documentation

    7. Maintenance:
        Objective: Maintain and improve the software post-deployment.
        Activities:
        Monitor software performance
        Fix bugs and issues
        Implement updates and enhancements
        Provide user support and training

Que2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts

Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects can be thought of as instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. OOP is designed to improve code reusability, scalability, and efficiency by modeling real-world entities and relationships.

Following are the OOP concepts:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Abstraction
7. Constructor
8. Destructor
9. Method Overloading
10. Method Overriding

Que14. What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Ans-> In Python, negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of a sequence (like lists, tuples, or strings). Instead of counting from the start (using positive indexes), negative indexes count backward, with -1 being the last element, -2 the second-last element, and so on.

Sometimes it's more convenient to reference the last or near-last elements without calculating the length of the sequence.
Example: In a list of recent events, events[-1] quickly accesses the most recent one.

Que43. Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
Ans-> The zip() function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) by aggregating elements at the same index in each iterable. It produces an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains elements from the input iterables that are at the same position.

zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)

Each iterable represents one of the collections (like lists or tuples) that you want to zip together.

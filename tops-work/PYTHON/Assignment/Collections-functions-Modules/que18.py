Que18. What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
Ans-> a tuple is a collection data type that is used to store an ordered sequence of elements, similar to a list. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable—meaning that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.

Defining a Tuple
Tuples are created by placing elements inside parentheses () separated by commas.
# Example of a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")

Feature	                    List	                             Tuple
Mutability	    Mutable (can be changed)	        Immutable (cannot be changed)
Syntax	        Defined with square brackets [ ]	Defined with parentheses ( )
Modification	Elements can be added,              Elements cannot be modified
                removed, or changed	
Performance	    Slower due to dynamic resizing	    Faster as they are fixed in size
Memory Usage	Uses more memory	                Uses less memory
Functions and   Supports many methods like          Limited methods (count(), index())
Methods         append(), remove(), pop(), etc.	
Use Case	    Used for collections that 	        Used for fixed collections that don’t 
                change over time                    change

13. What is HTTPS and URLs ?
-> 
    HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
        Definition: HTTPS is an extension of HTTP, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS ensures that data sent between a user's web browser and a web server is encrypted, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

        Key Features:
            1. Encryption: Uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt data, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it.
            2. Authentication: Ensures that the user is communicating with the intended server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
            3. Data Integrity: Protects data from being altered during transfer.
            4. URL Prefix: URLs using HTTPS begin with https://.
        Benefits:
            1. Security: Protects sensitive data, such as login credentials, payment information, and personal details.
            2. Trust: Users are more likely to trust and engage with websites that use HTTPS, as indicated by the padlock icon in the browser's address bar.
            3. SEO: Search engines like Google rank HTTPS sites higher than HTTP sites, improving visibility and traffic.

    URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
        Definition: A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is the address used to access resources on the Internet. It specifies the location of a resource as well as the protocol used to retrieve it.
            
        Structure of a URL:
            1. Scheme/Protocol: Indicates the protocol to be used. Common protocols include http, https, ftp, and mailto.
            2. Host/Domain Name: The address of the server where the resource is located (e.g., www.example.com).
            3. Port (Optional): Specifies the port number to be used. If omitted, defaults are used (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
            4. Path: The specific location of the resource on the server (e.g., /path/to/resource.html).
            5. Query String (Optional): Provides additional parameters for the resource, typically used in dynamic web pages (e.g., ?key1=value1&key2=value2).
            6. Fragment (Optional): Refers to a specific part of the resource, such as a section within an HTML document (e.g., #section2).

        Example URL Breakdown:
            https://www.example.com:443/path/to/resource.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#section2
            https: Protocol
            www.example.com: Domain name
            443: Port number (optional, often omitted)
            /path/to/resource.html: Path to the resource
            ?key1=value1&key2=value2: Query string (optional)
            #section2: Fragment identifier (optional)

        Uses:
            1. Accessing Web Pages: URLs are used to navigate to web pages and resources on the Internet.
            2. Linking: Embedded in hyperlinks to allow users to click and navigate to different resources.
            3. APIs: Used to access and interact with web APIs, passing parameters through query strings.

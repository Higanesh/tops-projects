    Examples of Web Servers:
        1. Apache HTTP Server: An open-source web server known for its flexibility and wide usage.
        2. Nginx: A high-performance server known for handling large amounts of concurrent connections with low resource usage.
        3. Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): A web server created by Microsoft, integrated with Windows Server.
        4. Lighttpd: Designed for speed and efficiency, particularly useful in environments with heavy loads.

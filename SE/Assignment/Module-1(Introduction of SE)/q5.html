5. what is middle level language ?
-> Middle-level languages, also known as intermediate-level languages, blend the features of both high-level and low-level programming languages. They are designed to provide a balance between the ease of programming found in high-level languages and the control over hardware resources typical of low-level languages. These languages offer a more human-readable syntax while still allowing for detailed manipulation of hardware.

eg. c, cpp.

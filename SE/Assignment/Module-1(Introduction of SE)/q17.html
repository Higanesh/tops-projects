17. What is DNS server ?
-> A DNS (Domain Name System) server is a specialized server on the internet that handles the process of converting human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1 for IPv4 or 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 for IPv6) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Importance of DNS:
    Human-Friendly Addressing: Allows users to use memorable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.
    Efficiency: DNS servers can cache queries, reducing the time it takes to resolve frequently accessed domain names.
    Scalability: Distributes the domain resolution process across many servers, supporting the growth of the internet.
    
DNS is a fundamental component of the internet, ensuring that users can access websites and services using easy-to-remember domain names.

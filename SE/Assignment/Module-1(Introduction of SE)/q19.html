-> A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the flow of data through a system. It illustrates how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs. DFDs are used to visualize the data processing steps and how data moves between different components within a system.

    Components of a DFD:
    1. External Entities: These are sources or destinations of data outside the system (e.g., users, other systems).
    2. Processes: Represent actions that transform data (e.g., checking user credentials, processing orders).
    3. Data Stores: Represent storage for data that is used or produced by processes (e.g., databases, files).
    4. Data Flows: Arrows that represent the movement of data between processes, data stores, and external entities.

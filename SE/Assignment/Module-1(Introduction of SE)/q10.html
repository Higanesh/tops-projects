10. What are the types of SDLC ?
-> There are several types of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, each with its own approach to organizing and executing the phases of software development. The choice of SDLC model depends on the project's requirements, complexity, and goals. Here are the most common SDLC models:

    1. Waterfall Model
        Description:
        A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
        Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and low risk of changes.

        Phases:
        Requirements
        Design
        Implementation
        Testing
        Deployment
        Maintenance

    2. Iterative Model
        Description:
        Develops the system through repeated cycles (iterations), allowing partial implementation of the system in each iteration.
        Suitable for projects where requirements are expected to evolve over time.
        
        Phases:
        Initial Planning
        Iterative Cycles (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing)
        Final Deployment

    3. Spiral Model
        Description:
        Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the waterfall model, focusing on risk analysis.
        Emphasizes early identification and mitigation of risks.
        
        Phases:
        Planning
        Risk Analysis
        Engineering
        Evaluation

    4. V-Model (Verification and Validation)
        Description:
        Extension of the waterfall model that emphasizes testing at each development stage.
        Ensures verification and validation of each phase.

        Phases:
        Requirements
        Design (High-Level and Low-Level)
        Implementation
        Verification and Validation (corresponding to each design phase)
        Testing (Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance)
    5. Agile Model
        Description:
        Focuses on iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.
        Breaks down projects into small, manageable increments (sprints).
        Promotes continuous customer feedback and iterative refinement.

        Phases:
        Initial Planning
        Iterative Cycles (Planning, Designing, Building, Testing)
        Final Deployment
    6. Scrum Model
        Description:
        A specific Agile methodology that organizes development into sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.
        Emphasizes roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.

        Phases:
        Sprint Planning
        Daily Scrum Meetings
        Sprint Development
        Sprint Review
        Sprint Retrospective

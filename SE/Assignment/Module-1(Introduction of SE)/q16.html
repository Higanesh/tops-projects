16. What is IP address ? Define IPV4 and IPV6 ?
-> An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

    1. IPv4
        Format: IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, typically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.01). Each number can range from 0 to 255.
        Example: 192.168.1.1
        Capacity: Supports approximately 4.3 billion addresses.
        
    2. IPv6
        Format: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers, written in hexadecimal and separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). This format allows for a significantly larger number of addresses.
        Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
        Capacity: Supports a vastly larger number of addresses (2^128), accommodating the growth of the internet and the need for more IP addresses.

4. what is low level language ?
-> A low-level language is a type of programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture. These languages are closely related to the hardware and are typically used for tasks that require direct manipulation of the hardware components of a computer. Low-level languages can be divided into two main categories: machine language and assembly language.

Types of Low-Level Languages

Machine Language (Machine Code):

Definition: The most basic form of programming language, consisting of binary code (0s and 1s) that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can directly execute.

Assembly Language:

Definition: A low-level programming language that uses symbolic names (mnemonics) for operations and memory locations, making it more readable than machine language.

15. What is networking ? Define LAN, WAN & MAN ?
-> 
    Definition: Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources and information. This can include hardware (e.g., routers, switches, cables) and software (e.g., protocols and services) that facilitate communication between devices.

    Types of Networks
        1. LAN (Local Area Network)
        Definition: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, school, office building, or closely situated group of buildings.
            Characteristics:
                High data transfer rates.
                Limited geographic range (typically up to a few kilometers).
                Often owned, controlled, and managed by a single organization or individual.
            Examples:
                A home network connecting a few personal devices (e.g., computers, printers).
                An office network connecting employee workstations, printers, and servers.
            Technologies:
                Ethernet (wired LANs)
                Wi-Fi (wireless LANs)

        2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
        Definition: A MAN is a network that spans a metropolitan area, connecting multiple LANs within a city or large campus.
            Characteristics:
                Covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN (typically a city or a large campus).
                Higher data transfer rates than WANs but lower than LANs.
                Often used to connect various branch offices or buildings within a city.
            Examples:
                A city's public Wi-Fi network.
                A university campus network that connects different buildings.
            Technologies:
                Ethernet (MANs can use high-speed Ethernet)
                Fiber optic cables
                Wireless technologies (e.g., WiMAX)

        3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
        Definition: A WAN is a network that spans a large geographic area, often a country or continent, and connects multiple smaller networks, such as LANs or MANs.
            Characteristics:
                Covers a broad area (can be nationwide or worldwide).
                Lower data transfer rates compared to LANs.
                Typically consists of leased telecommunication circuits.
                Often involves multiple organizations and service providers.
            Examples:
                The Internet, which connects millions of networks worldwide.
                A corporate WAN connecting branch offices across different cities or countries.
            Technologies:
                MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
                ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
                Frame Relay
                Satellite communication

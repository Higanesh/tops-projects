-> A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. It captures the functional requirements of a system, showing the various ways users interact with the system to achieve specific goals. Use Case Diagrams are used in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to depict the functionality of a system.

    Components of a Use Case Diagram:
    1. Actors: Entities that interact with the system (e.g., users, other systems).
    2. Use Cases: Specific functionalities or actions that the system can perform (e.g., login, make a payment).
    3. System Boundary: A box that represents the scope of the system.
    4. Relationships: Lines connecting actors to use cases, showing interactions.
